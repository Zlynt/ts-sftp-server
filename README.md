# TypeScript SFTP Server

Implement a simple SFTP Server using TypeScript and Node.js.
> **_NOTE:_**  This work is part of MACbioIDi2: Promoting the cohesion of Macaronesian regions through a common ICT platform for biomedical R & D & i (INTERREG program MAC2/1.1b/352).

> **Warning**
> Not all FTP methods are implemented.

Based on work by [@mscdex](https://github.com/mscdex) - [ssh2](https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2), [ssh2-streams](https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2-streams).
Inspired by the work of [@validityhq](https://github.com/validityhq) - [node-sftp-server](https://github.com/validityhq/node-sftp-server) and [@expressjs](https://github.com/expressjs) - [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express).

## How to use

1) First, import the SFTP Server module
```js
import SFTPServer from "ts-sftp-server";
```
2) Instanciate the server
```js
let sftpServer = new SFTPServer({
  port: 3000,
  privateKeyFilePath: PRIVATE_KEY_FILE_PATH,
  authMethods: ['password'],
  printMethods: {
    // Print to console on error (not mandatory to implement)
    onError: (msg: string) => {
      // console.log(msg);
    },
    // Print to console on operation success (not mandatory to implement)
    onSuccess: (msg: string) => {
      // console.log(msg);
    },
    // Print to console warnings (not mandatory to implement)
    onWarning: (msg: string) => {
      // console.log(msg);
    },
  },
});
```

3) Implement the following events

|Event                |Description                                                                                |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

|Auth                 |User authentication                                                                        |
|RENAME               |Rename a file/folder inside the server                                                     |
|REMOVE               |Remove file from the server                                                                |
|SETSTAT              |Change file properties                                                                     |
|WRITE                |Write changes to a file                                                                    |
|READ                 |Read file content                                                                          |
|OPENDIR              |Client request to open a certain directory                                                 |
|RMDIR                |Client request to remove a certain directory                                               |
|MKDIR                |Client request to create a certain directory                                               |
|READDIR              |Client request to read list of a directory's contents alongside that content's permissions |
|CLOSE                |Client closing pointer to a certain file/directory                                         |
|REALPATH             |Tell client information related to a path                                                  |
|LSTAT,STAT,FSTAT     |Tell client information related to a file/directory                                        |
